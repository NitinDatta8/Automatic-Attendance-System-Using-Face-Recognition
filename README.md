# MozoHack 2019
Above is a re-upload of everything that my team and I worked on and developed at the Mozohack 24-Hour Hackathon. This is a working model of our product, which has an AI assisted automated attendance system. Using basic hardware elements such as a 720 camera, institutions and offices can use our services to automate the attendance process.

Instructions:

Install and unpack electron inside the /main
Open Terminal and run electron using npm start
Default logins credentials are:

All codes are equipped with appropriate logs for debug. Deep comments will be added soon.
